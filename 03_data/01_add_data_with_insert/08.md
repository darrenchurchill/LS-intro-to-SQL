#### Problem

Check the schema of the `celebrities` table. What would happen if we specify a
`NULL` value for the `deceased` column, such as with the data below?

First Name | Last Name | Occupation            | D.O.B        | Deceased
----       | ----      | ----                  | ----         | ----
Elvis      | Presley   | singer musician actor | '01/08/1935' | NULL

#### Solution

In the `celebrities` schema, `deceased` has a no constraints, so you could
insert the data above with no error.
