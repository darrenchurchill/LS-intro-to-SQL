#### Problem

Check the schema of the `animals` table. What would happen if we tried to
insert the following data into the table?

Name             | Binomial Name            | Max Weight (kg) | Max Age (years) | Conservation Status
----             | ----                     | ----            | ----            | ----
Dove             | Columbidae Columbiformes | 2               | 15              | LC
Golden Eagle     | Aquila Chrysaetos        | 6.35            | 24              | LC
Peregrine Falcon | Falco Peregrinus         | 1.5             | 15              | LC
Pigeon           | Columbidae Columbiformes | 2               | 15              | LC
Kakapo           | Strigops habroptila      | 4               | 60              | CR

#### Solution

In the `animals` schema, there is a table constraint restricting `binomial_name'
to a unique value. In the table above, Doves and Pigeons have the same Binomial
Name, so the insertion would fail.
