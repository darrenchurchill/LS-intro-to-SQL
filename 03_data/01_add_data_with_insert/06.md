#### Problem

Look at the schema of the `celebrities` table. What do you think will happen
if we try to insert the following data?

First Name | Last Name | Occupation                       | D.O.B        | Deceased
----       | ----      | ----                             | ----         | ----
Madonna    |           | singer actress                   | '08/16/1958' | false
Prince     |           | singer songwriter musician actor | '06/07/1958' | true

#### Solution

In the `celebrities` schema, `last_name` has a `NOT NULL` constraint, so
inserting either of the 2 records above would result in an error.
